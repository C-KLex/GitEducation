# **Documentation Guideline**

## 1️⃣ **Write commit**

```bash
git commit -m "label: this is a commit summary" -m "this is a commit description (optional)" 
```

Commit Message Style: all **lowercase** letters

*Label Reference*:

- feat – a new feature is introduced with the changes
- fix – a bug fix has occurred
- chore – changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies)
- eg: chore: update xxx to latest version
- refactor – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- docs – updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files
- style – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.
- test – including new or correcting previous tests
- perf – performance improvements
- build – changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- revert – reverts a previous commit
